# Middleman Template

The base Middleman application used at [thoughtbot], ready to deploy
to [Netlify].

[thoughtbot]: https://thoughtbot.com/
[Netlify]: https://www.netlify.com/

## Prerequisites

- Ruby 2.6.2 (confirm by running `ruby --version`)

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Middleman installed:

    ```
    gem install middleman
    ```

1. Then run:

    ```
    middleman init PROJECT_NAME --template=thoughtbot/middleman-template
    ```

    This will create a new Middleman app in a `PROJECT_NAME` directory.

1. Move into the project directory, then start the Middleman server:

    ```
    bundle exec middleman server
    ```

    You should now be able to view the app at <http://localhost:4567>.

1. At this point, you have a fresh Middleman app on your local machine with an
   empty Git repository initialized. Your next steps might be:

    - Update `README.md` with your project specifics
    - Create a GitHub repository and add it as a remote
    - Create an initial Git commit and push it to GitHub
    - Setup CircleCI
    - Setup Hound
    - Setup deployment with Netlify

    Happy building!
